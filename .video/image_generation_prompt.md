Create a clean, abstract tech illustration that visually represents the concept of API-First desing and development.The image should feature a central, visually appealing document that functions as a node or hub symbolizing a single API definition, with five ( and _only_ five!) smooth, colorful lines radiating outward to five different end points representing five unique outputs. Use a vibrant and balanced color palette, with a different color for each output line. The design should be minimalist, with geometric shapes and flowing lines reminiscent of a well designed circuit board, avoiding excessive detail or clutter. Ensure the composition works well as a horizontal banner with space for a title overlay. The style should be modern, professional, and visually engaging, suitable for a technical blog post.

## Additional Guidance

- Focus on a central hub or node as the main element
- Use smooth, flowing lines to connect the hub to multiple outputs
- Avoid overly complex patterns or busy elements
- Ensure high contrast and vibrant colors for visual appeal
- Make the design abstract and symbolic rather than literal
- Leave negative space for potential text overlays
- Ensure the image conveys the idea of a unified source generating diverse outputs
- Ensure the entire image is visible and clear, with no cropped elements
- The image should be suitable for a blog post header, so consider the aspect ratio and dimensions
- The design should be adaptable for use in other promotional materials, such as social media or presentations
- Ensure the final image is high resolution and suitable for both web and print use
- Consider the target audience (developers, tech enthusiasts) and ensure the design resonates with them
- Consider the use of gradients or shading to add depth and dimension to the design
- Ensure the image is visually balanced and harmonious, with no dominant elements that could distract from the overall message.
- _Absoluly no text or code snippets should appear in the image. Graphics only._
- Consider the use of light and shadow to create a sense of depth and dimension
- Ensure the image is visually striking and captures the viewer's attention
