## London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)

One of the most notable external adopters of TypeSpec is the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), a major financial services and information provider.

### Background and Challenge

LSEG faced the significant challenge of integrating multiple APIs derived from different design schemas. This situation is common in large organizations, where APIs may have been created:

- At different times
- By different teams
- For different purposes (e.g., developing user interfaces or delivering data as files)
- Through acquisitions

This inconsistency made it difficult for LSEG to provide APIs with a unified customer experience and limited how customers could integrate them into their workflows.

### The TypeSpec Solution

LSEG adopted TypeSpec to bring consistency and efficiency to their API and SDK development. Their partnership with Microsoft included:

1. Initial design discussions
2. Implementation planning
3. Development of customized tooling
4. Training and knowledge transfer

LSEG specifically aimed to release versions of their APIs defined using TypeSpec, which would be used to generate OpenAPI specifications and SDKs in TypeScript and Python for internal and external customers.

### Custom Emitters for Specialized Needs

LSEG partnered with Microsoft's Industry Solutions Engineering (ISE) group to build a customized emitter tailored to LSEG's specific requirements. This emitter allowed LSEG to auto-generate easy-to-use SDKs for different user types, including financial coders and data scientists.

The SDKs were provided in TypeScript and Python, simplifying API interactions for their diverse user base, which includes both seasoned developers and financial professionals who may not have extensive coding experience.

### Benefits Realized

LSEG experienced several key benefits from adopting TypeSpec:

#### 1. Consistency Across APIs

TypeSpec helped LSEG ensure consistency across their APIs. In the past, maintaining consistency across OpenAPI specifications relied on error-prone copy/paste activities and cumbersome review sessions, rarely achieving complete success.

With TypeSpec, LSEG can now build APIs with a uniform design using high-level templates, reducing the need for repetitive tasks and minimizing errors.

#### 2. Efficiency and Speed

TypeSpec significantly reduced the amount of code needed to define API specifications. For LSEG, this meant their API designers could focus on additional critical tasks, speeding up the development process.

With TypeSpec, a ten-line code snippet can generate a hundred lines of an OpenAPI specification, drastically reducing manual effort.

#### 3. Enhanced Tooling

TypeSpec's advanced tools help catch errors early, leading to more robust APIs. This proactive error detection is crucial for maintaining high-quality API standards and reducing the time spent on debugging and revisions.

#### 4. Accessibility

The compact nature of TypeSpec, combined with its familiar JavaScript-style syntax, allowed even non-technical stakeholders at LSEG to participate in the API review and design process. This inclusiveness ensures that APIs are designed with a broader perspective, incorporating insights from various roles within the organization.

#### 5. API-First Development

As part of their transition to TypeSpec, LSEG adopted an API-first development approach, making APIs a central part of their product strategy. This approach ensures feature-parity between their native web APIs and the Python or TypeScript SDKs, while offering functionalities and workflows specific to the target environments.

### Challenges Encountered

LSEG did face some challenges in their TypeSpec adoption:

1. **Namespaces and Versioning**: They encountered issues with namespaces and versioning decorators, which are essential for preventing naming conflicts within LSEG's extensive API landscape.

2. **Emitter Consistency**: Existing emitters for Python and TypeScript did not consistently implement certain features, requiring additional development work.

3. **Cultural Shift**: Moving to TypeSpec required a cultural shift to fully embrace API-first development practices across the organization.

Despite these challenges, LSEG's overall experience with TypeSpec has been positive, and they continue to expand its use across their API portfolio.
