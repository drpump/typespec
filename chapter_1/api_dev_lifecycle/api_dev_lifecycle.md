# TypeSpec in the API Development Lifecycle

Understanding how TypeSpec fits into the broader API development lifecycle is essential for effectively leveraging its capabilities. This chapter explores how TypeSpec integrates into different phases of API development, from initial design to ongoing evolution.

## The API-First Approach

TypeSpec is designed to enable and enhance an API-first development approach. The API-first methodology puts the API design at the beginning of the development process, rather than treating it as an afterthought or a byproduct of implementation.

### Traditional vs. API-First Development

| Traditional Approach                            | API-First Approach                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Implementation first, API documented afterward  | API designed and agreed upon before implementation |
| API design influenced by implementation details | Implementation guided by API design                |
| Inconsistent APIs across an organization        | Consistent API patterns and practices              |
| Multiple, often inconsistent artifacts          | Single source of truth with derived artifacts      |

### The API-First Workflow with TypeSpec

With TypeSpec, the API-first workflow becomes:

1. **Design** the API in TypeSpec
2. **Review** the TypeSpec definition with stakeholders
3. **Generate** OpenAPI and other artifacts
4. **Implement** the API based on generated artifacts
5. **Test** against the API contract
6. **Deploy** the API
7. **Iterate** by updating the TypeSpec definition

This approach ensures that the API design receives appropriate attention and that all stakeholders have input before significant implementation effort is invested.

## Phase 1: API Design

The design phase is where TypeSpec shines brightest, providing a concise, expressive language for defining APIs.

### Designing with TypeSpec

TypeSpec enables a structured approach to API design:

```typespec
import "@typespec/http";
using TypeSpec.Http;

@service({
  title: "E-Commerce API",
  version: "2023-10-01",
})
namespace ECommerce;

model Product {
  @visibility("read")
  id: string;

  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: decimal;
  categories: string[];
  inStock: boolean;
}

@route("/products")
interface Products {
  @get
  list(): Product[];

  @get
  @route("/{id}")
  getById(@path id: string): Product | Error;

  @post
  create(@body product: Product): Product | Error;

  @put
  @route("/{id}")
  update(@path id: string, @body product: Product): Product | Error;

  @delete
  @route("/{id}")
  delete(@path id: string): void | Error;
}

@error
model Error {
  code: int32;
  message: string;
}
```

This TypeSpec code concisely defines:

- Data models
- API operations
- Routes
- Error responses

### Leveraging Design Patterns

TypeSpec enables the use of design patterns to ensure consistency across your API:

```typespec
// Reusable pagination pattern
model PagedResult<T> {
  items: T[];
  nextLink?: string;
  count: int32;
}

// Apply to different resource types
@route("/products")
interface Products {
  @get
  list(): PagedResult<Product>;
}

@route("/orders")
interface Orders {
  @get
  list(): PagedResult<Order>;
}
```

By defining these patterns once and reusing them, you ensure a consistent experience for API consumers.

### Design Validation

TypeSpec provides built-in validation during the design phase:

- **Type checking**: Ensures type consistency across your API
- **Linting**: Identifies potential issues based on best practices
- **Diagnostics**: Flags errors and warnings in your editor

These validations help catch issues early, during the design phase, rather than later during implementation or when the API is already in production.

## Phase 2: Collaborative Review

Effective API design requires input from multiple stakeholders. TypeSpec facilitates collaboration through its readable syntax and integration with standard development tools.

### Code-Based Reviews

TypeSpec definitions can be stored in version control systems like Git, enabling standard code review processes:

- Pull requests for API changes
- Commenting on specific lines
- Version history
- Branching for experimental features

For example, a pull request might show changes to a TypeSpec definition:

```diff
model User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
+ phoneNumber?: string;
+ address?: Address;
}

+ model Address {
+   street: string;
+   city: string;
+   state: string;
+   postalCode: string;
+   country: string;
+ }
```

Reviewers can easily see what's being added or changed in the API.

### Visualization and Documentation

For non-technical stakeholders, the generated OpenAPI can be viewed in tools like Swagger UI:

```bash
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/openapi3
```

This generates an OpenAPI specification that can be loaded into Swagger UI or other visualization tools, providing an interactive interface for exploring the API.

## Phase 3: Artifact Generation

Once the API design is finalized, TypeSpec can generate various artifacts to support implementation, testing, and documentation.

### Generating OpenAPI

The most common output from TypeSpec is an OpenAPI specification:

```bash
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/openapi3
```

This generates an OpenAPI 3.0 specification that can be used with a wide range of API tools and frameworks.

### Generating Client Libraries

TypeSpec can generate client libraries in multiple languages:

```bash
# Generate TypeScript client
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/http-client-javascript

# Generate C# client
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/http-client-csharp

# Generate Python client
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/http-client-python

# Generate Java client
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/http-client-java
```

These client libraries provide type-safe access to your API in their respective languages.

### Generating Server Code

TypeSpec can also generate server-side code to accelerate implementation:

```bash
# Generate C# server code
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/http-server-csharp

# Generate JavaScript server code
tsp compile . --emit @typespec/http-server-js
```

The generated server code includes:

- Controllers/route handlers
- Model classes
- Input validation
- API contracts

While you'll still need to implement the business logic, the generated code handles much of the boilerplate associated with API implementation.

## Phase 4: Implementation

With artifacts generated, development teams can implement the API following the defined contract.

### Server Implementation

The generated server code provides a framework that developers can fill in with business logic:

```csharp
// Generated controller
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("/products")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> ListProducts()
    {
        // TODO: Implement business logic
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

Developers implement the business logic while the generated code ensures the API adheres to the defined contract.

### Client Implementation

Applications consuming the API can use the generated client libraries:

```typescript
// Using a generated TypeScript client
const client = new ECommerceClient();

// Get all products
const products = await client.products.list();

// Get a specific product
const product = await client.products.getById("product-123");

// Create a new product
const newProduct = await client.products.create({
  name: "New Product",
  description: "A fantastic new product",
  price: 99.99,
  categories: ["electronics", "gadgets"],
  inStock: true,
});
```

The generated clients provide type safety and handle serialization, making it easier to consume the API correctly.

## Phase 5: Testing

TypeSpec facilitates API testing by providing a clear contract that can be used for validation.

### Contract Testing

With TypeSpec, you can implement contract testing to ensure your API implementation adheres to the defined specification:

```javascript
// Test that the API implementation matches the contract
test("GET /products returns a list of products", async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get("/products");

  // Validate the response against the OpenAPI schema
  expect(validateAgainstSchema(response.body, "ProductList")).toBe(true);
});
```

Contract testing ensures that the implementation doesn't drift from the specification.

### Integration Testing

Generated client libraries can be used in integration tests:

```typescript
test("Create and retrieve a product", async () => {
  const client = new ECommerceClient();

  // Create a product
  const newProduct = await client.products.create({
    name: "Test Product",
    description: "A product for testing",
    price: 9.99,
    categories: ["test"],
    inStock: true,
  });

  // Retrieve the created product
  const retrievedProduct = await client.products.getById(newProduct.id);

  // Verify the retrieved product matches the created one
  expect(retrievedProduct).toEqual(newProduct);
});
```

Using the generated clients in tests ensures that your test code also follows the API contract.

## Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation

When deploying the API, TypeSpec-generated artifacts play key roles in documentation and developer experience.

### API Documentation

The OpenAPI specification generated from TypeSpec can be used to create comprehensive documentation:

- Interactive documentation with Swagger UI
- Reference documentation
- API catalogs
- Developer portals

The documentation is automatically up-to-date because it's generated from the same source as the implementation.

### SDK Distribution

Generated client libraries can be packaged and distributed as SDKs:

```bash
# Package the TypeScript client
npm pack ./generated/typescript-client

# Package the Python client
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

These SDKs provide a convenient way for developers to consume your API with proper typing and built-in documentation.

## Phase 7: Evolution and Maintenance

APIs rarely remain static—they evolve over time. TypeSpec provides mechanisms to manage this evolution effectively.

### Versioning

TypeSpec's versioning support helps manage API changes:

```typespec
import "@typespec/versioning";
using TypeSpec.Versioning;

@service({
  title: "E-Commerce API",
})
@versioned(ApiVersions)
namespace ECommerce;

enum ApiVersions {
  v1: "2023-01-01",
  v2: "2023-10-01",
}

@route("/products")
interface Products {
  @get
  @added(ApiVersions.v1)
  list(): Product[];

  @get
  @route("/{id}")
  @added(ApiVersions.v1)
  getById(@path id: string): Product;

  @post
  @added(ApiVersions.v1)
  create(@body product: ProductCreate): Product;

  @put
  @route("/{id}")
  @added(ApiVersions.v1)
  update(@path id: string, @body product: ProductUpdate): Product;

  @delete
  @route("/{id}")
  @added(ApiVersions.v2)
  delete(@path id: string): void;

  @post
  @route("/batch")
  @added(ApiVersions.v2)
  batchCreate(@body products: ProductCreate[]): Product[];
}
```

This approach allows you to track when features were added and generate appropriate artifacts for each version of your API.

### Breaking Changes

When making breaking changes, TypeSpec helps manage the transition:

```typespec
model ProductV1 {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: decimal;
}

@added(ApiVersions.v2)
model ProductV2 {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: decimal;
  currency: string; // New required field
}

@route("/products")
interface Products {
  @get
  @added(ApiVersions.v1)
  @removed(ApiVersions.v2, "Use /v2/products instead")
  listV1(): ProductV1[];

  @get
  @route("/v2")
  @added(ApiVersions.v2)
  listV2(): ProductV2[];
}
```

The `@removed` decorator documents when and why an operation was removed, and can suggest alternatives for clients.

### Documentation of Changes

TypeSpec helps document API changes:

```typespec
@doc("Get a list of products")
@added(ApiVersions.v1)
@changed(ApiVersions.v2, "Added support for filtering by category")
@get list(@query category?: string): Product[];
```

These annotations can be used to generate change logs and migration guides for API consumers.
