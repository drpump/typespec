## Questions for Clarification

1. Do we have actual quotes from external users we can include? If so, who should be contacted to get approval for using them?

2. What specific companies/projects can we mention as TypeSpec users (with permission)?

3. What is the realistic timeline for the final 1.0 release after this RC?

4. What specific limitations of the code generation features should be highlighted to set proper expectations?

5. Are there any specific metrics or adoption statistics we can share to demonstrate community interest?
