TypeSpec 1.0-RC is Here - Build Faster Today, Scale Easier Tomorrow

Hello everyone,

On behalf of the TypeSpec team, I'm pleased to share that we've reached a significant milestone with TypeSpec, our open-source API modeling language, as we announce the 1.0 Release Candidate today.

**What TypeSpec Delivers:**
• A concise, human-readable language for API design and modeling
• API-first development approach that streamlines the entire API lifecycle
• Single source of truth that generates OpenAPI specifications, client libraries, and for the first time, server code!
• Reduced inconsistencies between API artifacts that frequently occur with manual maintenance

**What's in 1.0-RC:**
• Stable components ready for production use: compiler, core libraries, OpenAPI emitters, and VS Code support
• Preview features we're actively refining: Protocol Buffer support, client/server code generation for multiple languages, and specialized libraries

We've seen impressive early adoption both within Microsoft teams and with external partners like London Stock Exchange Group and Pinterest, who have shared positive feedback on how TypeSpec has transformed their API development workflows.

**Next Steps:**
• The 1.0-RC blog post is now live: https://typespec.io/blog/2025-03-31-typespec-1-0-release/
• We'd appreciate your help spreading awareness among your teams and partners
• Your feedback on the release candidate is crucial for our final 1.0 release
