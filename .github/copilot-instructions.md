We are writing a TypeSpec reference book for a target audience of API developers. We are assuming the reader is familiar with API design, but we are still targeting the language for understanding by talented junior developers. Using the document outline located in C:\Users\marioguerra\Work\microsoft-typespec\.tmp\claude*book\typespec_book_outline.md, draft content for the book. Use the reference material in this repo for fleshing out the content, \_DO NOT USE ANY OTHER SOURCES*, since this repo (and _ONLY_ this repo) represents the canonical state of the art for the language. Place the content in the same directory as the outline. Create sub-directories for part and within each part, subdirectories for each chapter. Split each bullet point into separate numbered documents. Optimize the language for readability, clarity, and comprehension. Use subtle visual elements to improve readability where warranted. Include ample code samples derived from the repo soruce material. Ask questions for anything that isn't clear, _DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS_.
