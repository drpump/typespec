# Imports

In TypeSpec, imports are essential for bringing in external files, libraries, or modules that you want to use in your definitions. This allows you to leverage existing code and maintain modularity in your projects.

## Importing TypeSpec Files

You can import other TypeSpec files using the `import` keyword followed by the path to the file. For example:

```typespec
import "./models.tsp";
```

This statement imports the `models.tsp` file located in the same directory as the current file.

## Importing JavaScript Files

TypeSpec also allows you to import JavaScript files. This can be useful when you want to integrate JavaScript functionality into your TypeSpec definitions. For example:

```typespec
import "./utils.js";
```

This statement imports the `utils.js` file, which may contain utility functions or constants that you want to use in your TypeSpec code.

## Importing Libraries

TypeSpec provides a variety of libraries that you can import to enhance your API definitions. For example, to import the TypeSpec REST library, you would use:

```typespec
import "@typespec/rest";
```

This statement imports the REST library, which provides decorators and models specifically designed for defining REST APIs.

## Summary

Using imports effectively allows you to create organized and maintainable TypeSpec projects. By importing necessary files and libraries, you can build upon existing code and ensure that your definitions are clear and concise.

As you work through your TypeSpec projects, remember to keep your imports organized and only include what is necessary for your definitions.
